## Demo Console App .NET Core

This is a simple application designed to exemplify .NET Core.
The intent is to have a solution built in Visual Studio and have the Console run on OSx or Linux.

This project shows a library being used by the console app. It also demonstrates Unit Testing the library
with xunit so that unit tests can be run outside of Windows.
